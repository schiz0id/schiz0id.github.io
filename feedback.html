	Hey, I heard your elite im not lol.  Anyway can you code an exploit for the
	NDS Browser to be able to download files either to the system memory or ds
	card? I don't want to hack your system, so why that you logged my IP I
	don't know.  But I'll give you 45-50 USD for this job...
	
	You hear of xhacker RAT do you know if it's legitimate?</pre>
<pre class="me">
	I don't own a Nintendo DS, so I don't have the Operating System available
	to me.  Plus, Microsoft keeps their stuff closed-source so people can't
	write exploits, which is why they have the most secure operating system.
	The Nintendo DS is without a doubt based on Windows.  It can't be based on
	Mac lol.  And no one uses Linux or UNIX anymore, so that about rules it
	out.

	If you do, however, open the source up, there probably is a way.  You can
	probably just try opening the Operating System in notepad and editing it
	that way.

	How big is the DS card?  Or the built-in memory?

	And yes, I have your IP.  Don't try anything funny.  I have telnet and sub7
	open at all times!

	Ah, yes, RaT.  He apparently died in a car wreck years ago after leaving
	SoldierX.  He's clever, and very few (including myself) know the truth.

	A project like this seems pretty in-depth.  The lowest I will go is 250,000
	USD.  This exploit will be worth a lot of money, so I'll need my fair cut
	upfront.  After that, you can sell it, destroy it, or do whatever you want
	with it.

	Is there really a point for keeping that website up, why don't you join my

	is helping you or your popularity.  As for as contributing to my site with

	just not outrageous amounts like 250,000 USD.</pre>

	They probably don't have telnet open on their machine because they're

Subject: Regarding Your 'Hack' Site.

	This was originally intended to be posted in your comment board on your
	website, but the char limit prevented the whole message from being posted:

	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 	Hello there, I must say.. this is a pretty thorough site, with tons of
	information.. if your intentions are to create an army of script kiddies. I
	find it amusing how you claim windows XP to be the most stable OS, and the
	best for hacking. What's that about Telnet being used to hack? Buddy,
	telnet wasn't created for hacking - it was intended to be used by companing
	to engage in file-sharing and online meetings; and is also outdated. I'll
	bet you work for microsoft, or know someone who works in those areas?
	Windows is definitely the worst choice for a 'hacker' OS. Listen, 'hacking'
	websites is a pretty immature thing to do, is it not? So tell me, why rant
	on and on about becoming mature? I do admire your determination to appear
	as though you are a hacker, however, I hate to be the one to tell you this
	- You aren't a hacker, but rather a script kiddie who could never achieve
	his goals. Incase anyone ever reads this, if you truly want to 'become' a
	hacker, I strongly suggest learning some low-level programming languages
	such as C, which will allow you to interact with the kernel. Also, grabbing
	a copy of an open-source operating system could never hurt. (Unix, Linux,
	etc..) Windows isn't for the '1337' as you call it.. windows is for those
	who do not wish to do anything more than play games and deface websites.
	(With the exception of business related activities). In conclusion to this
	long and effortless rant, I'd like to say: fuck you, go ahead and try
	living up to your threats.. lets hope they're not as empty as that head of
	yours. Whoops, guess I kinda stepped outta line huh? ;-) Yes, you have my
	ip, put those digits to use kiddo.</pre>
<pre class="me">
	Well, you obviously didn't read my whole site, because you would have
	caught the link on my fake 'about' page that sticks out like a sore thumb :

	http://www.elite-hackers-site.com/about

	So, in response to your long, effortless, and ineffective rant,  the joke's
	on you, kiddo.

	Did I step out of line there, idiot?  You're one of the many who have taken
	that site too seriously when I built it to amuse people who actually know
	what they are doing.  I honestly hope you got a laugh out of it, because
	that's what it was intended for.  Your e-mail was funny though, I
	appreciate you taking the time to put people in their place.

	Feel free to leave more comments, I love the feedback, good or bad.  What's
	great about that site is that the feedback is hilarious either way.  I hope
	you wont mind me posting this e-mail (I'll omit your address), I'm sure it
	will drive more people to the site.

	Cheers,

Subject: Sup!

	i have a question when i downloaded sub7 on ur website my virus program
	detected 3 back door trojan viruses why is that? that thought it was a
	program to elp me not hack me!! and plz do not hack me if this is a stupid
	question!! iam just trying to learn here iam 17 and want to learn all i
	can. ok kool thank i love your website and its a great help so far and i
	verry well admire your knowlage!!!</pre>
<pre class="me">
	Dear Mike Jabha,

	I fear that you fear nothing than the ordinary.  Sub7 is basically a virus
	within itself, being a backdoor and all.  The goal is to install the server
	on a victim's computer.  The server acts as the "open door" to that
	person's machine, which is why modern virus detectors will detect it.  It
	is basically up to you to be sure that they do not have a firewall or
	anti-virus program installed like you did, or Sub7 would be rendered
	useless.  Since Sub7 is the greatest hacking tool in the universe, it's no
	surprise that lamer anti-virus software companies wouldn't catch onto it
	sooner or later.

	Don't worry about the virus being detected on your computer, it's normal. 
	It is your job as a skilled hacker to find a way to plant that virus onto
	another computer so you can mess around with it.  My favorite (as an elite
	hacker) is the open/close CD ROM drive feature.

	You're well on your way to becoming a true hacker, and I appreciate the
	feedback.  Never be afraid to ask questions.  Be sure to pass the site on
	to whoever might be interested.  The site is growing pretty quickly and
	more people are finding out about it, so be sure to check back often for
	updates.

	Happy hacking, future warrior.

	Dear Hunter Krieg,	

	First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to e-mail me.  It is
	good to ask questions, knowledge is power.  A good step to becoming a
	hacker is knowing that there are no such things as "stupid questions."
	
	I did forget to cover port hacking on my site.  I will have to update it.  
	I didn't mention a thing about it for the same reasons I never mentioned
	Linux or UNIX:  no one uses ports.  In immature terms, "ports are for
	n00bs."
	
	What I would recommend is for you to dab around in Delphi and learn more
	about exploiting sockets.  Those are much more widely used than something
	as old as "Ports."  Learning something like Delphi and how they interact
	with modern sockets will lead you to the answer of your firewall question. 
	Learn how to exploit the socket of a firewall, and it will all begin to
	unfold.
	
	You probably came across my site through a forum or a search engine.  Tap
	those resources.  They are much more valuable than what meets the eye.  And
	thank you for visiting my site.  People like you are what keep my site
	going, and that sir, is no lie.
	
	Happy hacking,

Subject: hello my fellow hacker.

	hello, I have spent the last 3 years learning all about computers(on the
	side from highschool).  After reading your website I am not convinced that
	you are an "elite hacker".  There were a few good points, chain-hacking,
	and not using stuff 1ik3 this when talking.  Please justify how windows
	vista or even xp are good hacking systems?  The comment about linux never
	being used is a load of _____.  Its used for many cooperate websites and
	personal websites.  In fact microsoft aka owners of windows, uses linux for
	some of their servers.  As for hacking (the correct term is cracking) linux
	is better because both xp and vista do not support raw sockets.  You might
	want to get the facts on your site right as well.  Windows was not the
	first OS.  In 1981 microsoft released ms-dos not windows.  Not only that
	but Unix has been around since the 70s and is also used alot for business
	servers.  The only stealing that took place was mac stole the gui idea from
	the xerox.  Microsoft then took the gui idea from mac/apple.  Ping is not a
	cracking tool that "steals ips"  all it does when u see the ip is it
	resolves the url back to an ip.  Actually what happens is: you sent a
	request to a dns server(most likely at your isp) and it sends the ip to
	you.  Then you send 4 IMCP packets to the target server and it chooses to
	respond.  Man b4 u make websites about hacking learn about TCPIP and DNS. 
	Download and try out linux, its free and open source knoppix is a good
	place to start.  You download the iso and burn it to a disk and it runs
	right from there.  No install needed.  whatever, you have my ip on your
	server.  hack me and prove your skills or just e-mail me back and prove it
	though some actual cracker knowledge.  I know html, css, vbscripting,
	visual basic, c++, and about everything about windows ha ha.  This may help
	u hack me.  12.205.82.213 is my IP.  Telnet server is on. apache is on,
	running windows vista home premium.</pre>

Subject: Hello again.

	hey thats really low. You did not use notepad to write your site. You used an editor.  As for stealing your code, your 
	javascript code was never yours.  Dumbass if you know javascript you would have deleted the comments.  Heres "your code". 
 
	window.onload = function()
	{
 	  //right click script by http://www.hypergurl.com
  	  var debug = true;
   	  function right(e)
    	  {
      	    if (navigator.appName == 'Netscape' && (e.which == 3 || e.which == 2))
            {
       	      alert("Don't steal my code, n00b!");
              return false;
	    }
            else if (navigator.appName == 'Microsoft Internet Explorer' && (event.button == 2 || event.button == 3))
            {
              alert("Don't steal my code, n00b!");
              return false;
            }
            return true;
          }
	  document.onmousedown=right;
  	  if (document.layers)
	  {
	    window.captureEvents(Event.MOUSEDOWN);
	    window.onmousedown=right;
	  }
	  //script for nav hover effect here
	  //
	}

Now whats that in the 3rd line of your js file "right click script by hypergirl.com" ???

Also there's tons of proof that you used an editor for your html code.
Bottom line, YOUR NOT AN ELITE HACKER YOUR A NOOB!

	I am completely baffled i the fact that you call yourself a HACKER that is
	not your right , it is the decision of others to decide if you are deemed
	good enough.  A real hacker stays in the dark never boasting, creping in
	the silence. The quieter you become the more you hear i quote 

	"Q: What is this Linux/UNIX thing all about?
	A: There is a reason that I don't cover Linux or UNIX in my writings. That
	being because NOBODY USES IT! Linux and Unix came along after Apple, which
	followed Windows.  I have reason to believe that UNIX and Linux stole code
	from these two great OS's to produce what they have now -- which isn't
	much. Most of the time running Linux and UNIX is spent in what they call a
	shell, like DOS. This makes a hacker's job extremely boring and difficult.
	Stick to the original pros, Microsoft and Apple know what they are doing."

	you are so fucking wrong belive me unix  and unix styles are a lot more
	common than you think, and this utter bullshit UNIX was first then windows
	then linux.get your facts right loser and how dare you say windows was
	stolen by mac, Linux and UNIX "Most of the time running Linux and UNIX is
	spent in what they call a shell, like DOS. This makes a hacker's job
	extremely boring and difficult"

	Your probably too young to remember the beginning of freeBSD which has had 
	the konsole in which you have many different shell environments, in which
	you can 100% customize to its full potential for scripting and HAND
	BUILDING PROGRAMS not like you sub7 shit, you are nothing but a shit faces
	little script kiddie who doent know how to hanndle th real shit and who has
	seen a few hacker films and thought, hell i could do that so u read a few
	books and think you  are the best but you aint belive me.

	you clearly have never really  understood the ethics of a hacker and the
	YEARS -not months- it takes you to home you skills and be able exploit the
	flaws  on each target,you rely on pre made software ha.

 	i want to now if my handle is ok to use and its not used yet the name below
	is my handle z3r0 c00l</pre>
<pre class="me">
 	z3r0 c00l,

 	I was thinking about your name, and yes, it seems to fit you well.  You are
	about 0% cool.

 	You should try something like....inph1nity.  That sounds a lot better.  Let
	me know what you think!

<pre class="idiot">
 	yea i like it its a good handle does it say infinity and ur such a smart
	ass about z3r0 c00l</pre>
<pre class="me">
 	Dear z3r0 c00l,

 	You just have to keep in mind that out-of-the-box spelling along with a
	clever description makes for a real good handle.  Instead of conforming to
	the norm and spelling infinity the normal way, I threw in a 'ph' to
	substitute the 'f.'  That along with a 1 for the 'i' makes a really nice
	looking handle.  Plus, if anyone asks what exactly your handle means, you
	can respond with something cunning like "It's the only word I could think
	of to describe my level of eliteness." 

 	You follow?  That way they'll know that you know what you are doing, and
	that you're not to be meddled with. 

 	Let me know if you need me to clarify anything.

 	thx schiz0id i will go with inph1nity and hey do u no ne 1 that can be my
	mentor so i can become a better elite</pre>
<pre class="me">
 	inph1nity,

 	I'm glad you have chosen to stick with that handle, I think it suits you
	well.

 	As for a mentor, I would love to teach everyone the art of hacking (I've
	been approached several times!), but I just don't have the time.  I would
	recommend my good friend, dividesbyzer0, except he's in the same situation.

 	I haven't talked to another friend of mine in a while, their name is Acid
	Burn.  I'm not sure of where their whereabouts, but if you look around
	online I'm sure you can find an e-mail address to get in touch.  I think
	that would be the best contact for you.

 	Let me know how it goes.  When you find Acid Burn, drop my name.  That will
	get your foot in the door;  we've known each other since 1995 when we met
	in a project where we hacked the Gibson.  Good luck.

	you're having a problem with the bigger words, just sound them out.

	to lazy to think of my own and i havent seen ne body use it so i went with

	in the first place</pre>
<pre class="me">
 	Dear "inph1nity"

 	I don't tell everyone that my site is a joke so I can trick idiots into
	e-mailing me with stupid questions.  That way I can post the e-mails on my
	feedback page for smarter people to read.

 	I'm going to guess that you're either 12 or 13 years old, am I right?
